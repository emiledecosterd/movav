# Movav

Implementation of a moving average filter for use in embedded applications such as firmware for PIC or AVR micro-controllers. Implements
* Choice of window size
* Window size up to 256 samples (depending on the used MCU, this could be more than the available memory. Be careful!)

The library allocates memory for a buffer which size is the window size.

# Examples

The project contains simple tests to demonstrate the features of the library. A makefile is provided so you can build the project  directly from the console.

```
make
```

The program performs a series of simple tests. You can modify these tests directly in the `tests.c` file.
